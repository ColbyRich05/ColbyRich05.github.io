I just created this github account and will use it to practice creating code.
The repository I have created is a clone that will be used to practice my code.
Once I made my github account, I downloaded the GitHub desktop, clicked on the plus in the top right corner, clicked on clone repository, and clicked on "Colbyrich05.github.io".
