I just created this github account and I will be using it for practicing creating code.
The repository I have created is a clone and it will be used for practicing my code.
Once I made my github account, I downloaded the github desktop and clicked on the plus in the top right corner and click on clone repository and clicked on "Colbyrich05.github.io".
